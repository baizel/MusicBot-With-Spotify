<h1> Usage </h1>
In discord use {pre-fix}spotify spotify:Uri:Format:like:This <br>
This works by getting a spotify URI then using Spotify API to get all the tracks inside the playlist. Then playing them using the built-in play method.

<h1> Disclaimer </h1>
This DOES NOT stream from Spotify. Only gets Track Names and then uses youtube to get the music
